\section sect_bdnsim_description nSIM Virtual Board Description

The DesignWare&reg; ARC&reg; nSIM Instruction Set Simulator provides an instruction accurate processor model for the DesignWare ARC processor families. Such processor models take the software development out of your products’ critical path by enabling an early start as well as increased efficiency through enhanced visibility and control. A basic test environment for nSIM is implemented in embARC, where hostlink IO is used for message input and output. ARC related functions can be tested using nSIM such as internal timer, cache module, interrupt and exception module.

\section sect_bdnsim_usage How to Run in embARC

For example, go to <b>example/baremetal/arc_feature/timer_interrupt</b> and enter **gmake BOARD=nsim TOOLCHAIN=mw run** to test the timer example on nSIM.

\note Most middlewares in embARC are not available for nSIM since there is no external peripheral for nSIM.
